# This is a header.
  Does not work properly
  
  #VeryCoolReally

  I don't know what to say here. Wow, the terms  'x' is nice, and the type ':U' as well.
  !`wow` but the rest is inline   $x$ that is latex
  #presentation *hello* **hello**   ***cool* nice  **
  #executable
  
  and that's how it works.

  # This is a header
  ## This is a subheader
  ### This is a subsubheader

    I know that stuff can be complicated, but do we really need to 
    make it harder than it already is?
    
    I am not sure if this is the right approach to markup, but hey, let's try ...


  #executable expand collapse hide
  $x$ 
  math
  #list
    # This is a header in a list
      which 
      
    hey, this is really good stuff,
      why don't we go home?
    I don't know, can we do this later?  

    Indented text could be: Edit Mode ProofScript, Display Mode ProofScript, Executable ProofScript, Math, Verbatim, Quote
    # Do you think that this is fun?
    def t = 10
    def s = 20
